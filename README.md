# Swift data structures

I could not find a good Swift implementation of some essential data structures, so I made them. Hope this saves you some time.

Data structures:

- [Queue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queue_(abstract_data_type))
- [Stack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_(abstract_data_type))
- [Linked list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_list)
- [Circular array](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_buffer)
